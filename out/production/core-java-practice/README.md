# core-java-practice
Fast-track learning and revision: Covers all essential Java building blocks.

## Overview

This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for mastering the foundational elements of the Java programming language. It is structured to facilitate systematic learning, revision, and practical application of core Java concepts. The content is curated to support both academic study and professional interview preparation.

## Objectives

- To provide a modular and organized approach to learning core Java.
- To offer concise and executable code examples for each major concept.
- To support learners in building a strong foundation for advanced Java frameworks and backend development.

## Directory Structure

### Language Fundamentals
- `syntax-basics/` — Covers variables, data types, operators, control structures, and basic input/output.
- `oop-principles/` — Demonstrates object-oriented programming concepts including inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.
- `collections-framework/` — Introduces Java Collections API with practical usage of List, Set, Map, and Iterator interfaces.
- `java-streams/` — Explores the Stream API for functional-style operations on collections.
- `exception-handling/` — Provides examples of exception types, try-catch blocks, custom exceptions, and best practices.
- `file-io/` — Includes file reading/writing operations using both traditional and NIO approaches.
- `multi-threading/` — Covers thread creation, synchronization, concurrency utilities, and thread-safe patterns.

### Supplementary Modules
- `interview-snippets/` — Contains frequently asked coding questions and logic-based exercises.
- `design-patterns/` — Implements common design patterns such as Singleton, Factory, Strategy, and Observer using Java.
- `java-8-features/` — Highlights enhancements introduced in Java 8 including lambda expressions, functional interfaces, and stream operations.

## Usage

Users are encouraged to clone the repository and explore each module independently. Code samples are designed to be self-contained and executable in standard Java environments. This repository may also be used as a reference for teaching, technical documentation, or content creation.
