        //Ans: Only if synchronization is required and I don’t want to manage it externally.
        // Otherwise, HashMap or ConcurrentHashMap are better suited for modern applications.
        //Thread-safe via method-level synchronization
        //No null keys or values
        //Slower due to coarse-grained locking
        //Legacy class (since Java 1.0)
        //No. Duplicate keys are not allowed.
        //If you call put(key, value) with a key that already exists, the old value is overwritten.
        //The key remains unique—only one entry per key is stored.
